            <h1>Who we are.</h1>
            <p>We believe in a world where you have total freedom to be you, without judgement. To experiment. To express yourself. To be brave and grab life as the extraordinary adventure it is. So we make sure everyone has an equal chance to discover all the amazing things they’re capable of – no matter who they are, where they’re from or what looks they like to boss. We exist to give you the confidence to be whoever you want to be.</p>

            <h1>Fashion democracy</h1>
            <h1>Choice for all</h1>
            <p>Our audience (AKA you) is wonderfully unique, and we do everything we can to help you find your fit. We offer our Sherman's Brands in more than 30 sizes – and we're committed to providing all sizes at the same price – so you can be confident we’ve got the perfect thing for you.</p>

            <h1>Body positivity</h1>
            <p>It’s important for us to promote a healthy body image – we’re not about conforming to any stereotypes – so we work with more than 200 models to represent our audience. And we’re not in the business of digitally altering their appearance either… there’s no reshaping or removing stretch marks here. Our models are part of the Sherman's family and we support them by following a Model Welfare Policy.</p>

            <h1>ParalympicsGB partnership</h1>
            <p>We’re more than honoured to be an official partner of the British Paralympic Association, providing the ParalympicsGB team with their formal and ceremonies outfits. Creating bespoke collections that meet the athletes’ needs, as well as making them look and feel great, is a privilege and has improved our learning about designing adaptive clothing.</p>

            <h1>Sherman's Marketplace</h1>
            <p>You know that satisfying feeling when you stumble across an incredible vintage boutique, or uncover an amazing independent brand, before everyone else? Yeah, we love that too. That’s why we created Sherman's Marketplace in 2010. The team seeks out the best fashion start-ups, so you can shop one-of-a-kind finds all the time.</p>

            <h1>PEOPLE AND THE PLANET</h1>
            <p>We’re serious about making sure every person in our global supply chain is safe at work and has their rights respected and protected. We set high ethical standards and support our suppliers to help them meet them. Our priorities include transparency; improving wages; health and safety; addressing and reducing modern-slavery risks, and identifying and stopping child labour.</p>

            <h1>Planet</h1>
            <p>We’ve set ourselves ambitious targets to reduce the impact we have on the planet and we’re always looking for new ways to get better. We also work hard to ensure animals don’t suffer for fashion and have strict sourcing guidelines for animal-derived materials and producing animal-free products.</p>

            <h1>Sherman's Foundation</h1>
            <p>We set up the Sherman's Foundation because we believe everyone deserves access to the same opportunities. It achieved full charity status in 2013 and provides infrastructure, training and support to enable disadvantaged young adults to reach their potential. Our mission is to inspire young people to break down barriers and, ultimately, to achieve amazing things. We have so many experts in fashion and tech who love to pass on their talent through the Foundation – it’s one of our favourite parts of being Sherman's, and we hope we can change lives.</p>
